# fps-monitoring-capture-cards
Stream-compatible external overlay that will display FPS metrics and the resolution.
Currently displays:
- Current Resolution
- Current FPS
- Average FPS (in a 5 minute window)
- 1% Low FPS (in a 5 minute window)
- FPS Graph (in a 200 seconds window) 

It also comes with a device selector to choose which capture card to use.

Tested with an El Gato 4K 60 Pro MK.2, can't guarantee compatibility with non PCIE capture cards.
